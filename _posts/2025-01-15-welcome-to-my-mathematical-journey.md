## My Background

As an MSc Mathematics graduate from IIT Delhi, I'm currently seeking PhD opportunities in Number Theory, Analysis, and Algebra. This blog serves as both a platform to share knowledge and a way to document my ongoing mathematical journey.

## Recent Mathematical Thoughts

One of my favorite identities is Euler's beautiful equation:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

This simple equation connects five of the most important mathematical constants: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$. It beautifully demonstrates the deep connections between seemingly different areas of mathematics.

## Stay Connected
